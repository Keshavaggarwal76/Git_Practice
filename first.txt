this is version 1 of my project.

if we write *.log in .gitignore file & dir/ then it ignore all log file & dir but if we write /dir/ then only ignore
outside dir folder not inside dir folder of static.

if we rename file name from a to b, & then run git status it shows a is deleted & b is added. Then if we run git add .
it shows a is renamed to b.

git status                 - gives status of repository & if we change in any file than it detects it on running again
git init                   - initialise repository
git add --a/.              - stage new & modified which are not deleted if we delete something it will be skiped
git add -A                 - stage all
git add -u                 - stage modified & deleted, without staging new files
git commit -m "message"    - commit all files
git commit -a -m "message" - commit all files that are tracked or in staging area, skip that are untracked("second,txt")
git log                    - give timestamp of commits
rm -rf .git                - removes .git repository
touch file_name            - makes file in repository
git diff                   - compare working directory with staging area
git diff --staged          - compare prvious commit with staging area
