this is version 1 of my project.

if we write *.log in .gitignore file & dir/ then it ignore all log file & dir but if we write /dir/ then only ignore
outside dir folder not inside dir folder of static.

git status               - gives status of repository & if we change in any file than it detects it on running again
git init                 - initialise repository
git add --a/.            - add all files to staging area, use --a or .
git commit -m "message"  - commit all files
git log                  - give timestamp of commits
rm -rf .git              - removes .git repository
touch file_name          - makes file in repository
git diff                 - compare working directory with staging area
git diff --stage         - compare prvious commit with staging area
