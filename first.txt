if we write *.log in .gitignore file & dir/ then it ignore all log file & dir but if we write /dir/ then only ignore
outside dir folder not inside dir folder of static.
if we rename file name from a to b, & then run git status it shows a is deleted & b is added. Then if we run git add .
it shows a is renamed to b.

git status                 - gives status of repository & if we change in any file than it detects it on running again
git init                   - initialise repository

git add --a/.              - stage new & modified which are not deleted if we delete something it will be skiped
git add -A                 - stage all
git add -u                 - stage modified & deleted, without staging new files

git clone repo_address     - clone external file in to repository in which git opened
git clone repo_address .   - clone external file in to repository in which git opened without creating a new folder

git commit -m "message"    - commit all files
git commit -a -m "message" - commit all files that are tracked or in staging area, skip that are untracked("second,txt")

git log                    - give timestamp of commits

notebook .gitignore        - opens gitignore in notebook format
rm -rf .git                - removes .git repository
touch file_name            - makes file in repository

git diff                   - compare working directory with staging area
git diff --staged          - compare prvious commit with staging area

git reset file_name        - unstage the files
git rm file_name           - Remove file & stage it, commit it after afterward to finalise

git checkout file_name     - Move back to the previous commit
git checkout .             - All files Move back to the previous commit
git mv file_name file2     - Rename file & stage it.

git branch                 - shows master
git branch f_name          - creates a another branch of master as f_name but didn't switch to f_name
git checkout f_name        - it will switch branch from master to f_name
git merge f_name           - merge f_name with master
git branch -d f_name       - deletes f_name branch
git push origin --delete f - deletes f branch from git also

git push origin branchname - push branchname (eg: master, f_name)

git rm --cached f          - Untrack the file (if we write f in .gitignore then make changes to it, 
                                                it show modified as we tracked it previously before addind to .gitignore)
